<div class="transnote"><p><b>Transcriber's Notes</b>:</p>

<p>This early English text was printed in a black-letter font. Some of the
letters used are not found on a typewriter. In the e-text those
letters that have no modern equivalent are transcribed with their
meaning. For example, there is a letter that looks like a "w" with a "t"
over it. This means with. You will find this in the text as [with].
Others you will find are [the], [that], and [thou].  You will also
find the suffix [us].</p>

<p>All typos were kept as close as possible to the original. This e-text
is based on the 1907 edition which included a long list of these typos
and some of their possible meanings along with the editor's note. This
list had many letters typeset upside down. For this e-text they were
righted.</p>

<p>Long s's are used as the html entity &amp;#383; and look like this:
&#383;.  If that character does not look right, your font does not support
long s's and you may want to try a more complete font.</p>

<p>In the original most of the stage directions were not set apart from the
rest of the text.  I separated the stage directions from the text and put them
in italics.</p>

<p><a name="editors_notes" id="editors_notes"></a>Early in the craft year which began on 19 July 1557, and was the first
of the chartered existence of the Stationers' Company, John Waley, or
Wally, entered what was no doubt the present play on the Register along
with several other works. The entry runs as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>To master John wally these bokes Called Welth and helthe/the
treatise of the ffrere and the boye / stans puer ad mensam another
of youghte charyte and humylyte an a b c for cheldren in englesshe
with syllabes also a boke called an hundreth mery tayles ij<sup>s</sup>
[Arber's Transcript, I. 75.]</p></div>

<p>That Waley printed an edition is therefore to be presumed, but it does
not necessarily follow that the extant copy, which though perfect bears
neither date nor printer's name, ever belonged to it. Indeed, a
comparison with a number of works to which he did affix his name
suggests grave doubts on the subject. Though not a high-class printer,
there seems no reason to ascribe to him a piece of work which for
badness alike of composition and press-work appears to be unique among
the dramatic productions of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>'Wealth and health' appears among the titles in the list of plays
appended to the edition of Goffe's <i>Careless Shepherdess</i>, printed for
Rogers and Ley in 1656. The entry was repeated with the designation
'C[omedy].' in Archer's list of the same year, and, without the
addition, in those of Kirkman in 1661 and 1671. In 1691 Langbaine wrote
'<i>Wealth and Health</i>, a Play of which I can give no Account.' Gildon has
no further information to offer, nor have any of his immediate
followers. Chetwood, in 1752, classes it among 'Plays Wrote by Anonymous
Authors in the 16th [by which he means the seventeenth] Century,' calls
it 'an Interlude' and dates it 1602. This invention was only copied in
those lists which depended directly on Chetwood's, such as the
<i>Playhouse Pocket-Companion</i> of 1779. Meanwhile, in his <i>Companion to
the Play-House</i> of 1764, D.E. Baker, relying upon Coxeter's notes, gave
an essentially accurate description of the piece, except that he
asserted it to be 'full of Sport and mery Pastyme,' and described it as
an octavo. This entry has been copied by subsequent bibliographers, none
of whom have seen the original.</p>

<p>The play was among those discovered in Ireland in the spring of 1906 and
sold at Sotheby's on 30 June, when it was purchased for the British
Museum at the price of one hundred and ninety-five pounds. Its
press-mark is C. 34. i. 25.</p>

<p>The extremely careless typography of the original makes the task of
reprinting a difficult one. Ordinary misprints abound, and these have
been scrupulously retained, a list of irregularities being added below.
It has, however, proved impossible to arrive at any satisfactory method
of distinguishing between 'n' and 'u.' In the first hundred lines, which
are by no means the worst printed, there are thirty-two cases in which
the letter is indistinguishable, eighteen cases of an apparent 'u' which
should be 'n,' and seven cases of an apparent 'n' which should be 'u.'
When it is further remembered that there are few cases in which it is
possible to say for certain that a letter really is what it appears to
be, and none in which it may not be turned, some idea of the difficulty
in the way of reprinting will be obtained. To have followed the original
in this matter would have been to introduce another misprint into at
least every fourth line, while even so several hundred cases would have
remained which could only have been decided according to the apparent
sense of the passage. The only rational course was to treat the letters
as indistinguishable throughout, and to print in each instance
whichever the sense seemed to require. Again, as the superscript letters
'c,' 'e,' 't,' are seldom distinguishable, the printer has been given
the benefit of the doubt. Another difficulty arose in connection with
the speakers' names. In the original these have often dropt from their
proper places, which can now only be ascertained from the sense and the
not very regular indentation. With some hesitation it has been decided
to restore them to the positions they should apparently occupy, noting
all cases in which they are a line or more out in the original. Lastly
it may be remarked that in the speeches which aim at imitating foreign
languages the apparent readings of the very indistinct original have
been scrupulously reproduced, and no attempt has been made, even in the
subjoined list, to suggest any corrections.</p>

<p>In the last sheet some of the pages are cropt at the foot. In most cases
nothing more than the catchword has disappeared, and although between
lines 768 and 769 something seems to be lost, it is doubtful whether
this is due to the cropping, since D1<sup>v</sup> has already one line too many.</p>

<p>The original is printed in the ordinary black letter of the period, of
the body known as English (20 ll. = 94 mm.).</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

1.E.9.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
